Contact willem AT vanbergen DOT org if you want to help out


New features:
- Search fields of associations as well
- Allow other search operators than %LIKE% 

Refactoring:
- Create a separate class to build the actual SQL queries.
- For searchable_on(*fields) make it so that instead of fields it accepts options (a hash) where 
  :only and :except can be values.  That way it is possible for all fields to be loaded except 
  the ones specified with :except.
- Add checks for field types because the latest version of PostgreSQL (version 8.3.3) is more 
  strict about searching for strings in columns that are not string types.

Documentation & testing:
- Put something useful in the wiki
- Add rdoc en comments to code
