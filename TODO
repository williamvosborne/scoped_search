New functionality:
- Search model associations as well
- Allow OR-queries

Refactoring:
- Better separation of query building and query string parser
- For searchable_on(*fields) make it so that instead of fields it accepts options (a hash) where 
  :only and :except can be values.  That way it is possible for all fields to be loaded except 
  the ones specified with :except.
- Add checks for field types because the latest version of PostgreSQL (version 8.3.3) is more 
  strict about searching for strings in columns that are not string types.

Testing:
- More tests for the query string parser
