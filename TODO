Contact willem AT vanbergen DOT org if you want to help out


New features:
- Search fields of associations as well
- Allow smart searches.  Example: "90 days ago", "Yesterday", "10 days from now" 

Refactoring:
- For searchable_on(*fields) make it so that instead of fields it accepts options (a hash) where 
  :only and :except can be values.  That way it is possible for all fields to be loaded except 
  the ones specified with :except.

Documentation & testing:
- Put something useful in the wiki
- Add rdoc en comments to code
