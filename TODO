0.4.0
Refactoring:
- For searchable_on(*fields) make it so that instead of fields it accepts options (a hash) where 
  :only and :except can be values.  That way it is possible for all fields to be loaded except 
  the ones specified with :except.

New features:
- Search fields of associations as well
