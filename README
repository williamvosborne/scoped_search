scoped_search
=========================================================
This simple plugin will make it easy to search your ActiveRecord models. 
A simple example to demonstrate its use:

-- 
class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
	searchable_on :name, :description
end

Project.search_for(params[:q]).each { |project| ... }
-- 

This functionality is build on named_scope. The searchable_on statement creates 
a named_scope "search_for". Because of this, you can actually chain the call with
other scopes. For example, this can be very useful if you only want to search in 
projects that are accessible by a given user.

-- 
class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
	searchable_on :name, :description
	named_scope :accessible_by, lambda { |user| ... }
end

# using chained named_scopes and will_paginate
Project.accessible_by(current_user).search_for(params[:q]).paginate(:page => params[:page], :include => :tasks)
--
